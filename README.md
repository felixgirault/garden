# My humble garden ðŸŒ±

This is the source code and content of
[my digital garden](https://fglt.fr) (read
[A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
if you're unfamiliar with the concept).

I'll try and build this in the open, fighting my urge for
perfectionism, so it'll be an ever-evolving website.

I'll strive to use bare web technologies as much as possible,
leading to a simple and efficient website. I'm currently betting
on [Astro](https://astro.build/) to provide just the right level
of abstraction.
