_A classic city builder with a sumptuous atmosphere._

One of the first games I played as a kid, that I keep coming back
to over the years. The graphics and soundtrack together are
really transporting you in a different world.

Although being quite relaxing, it is also quite demanding at
times, as you've got to build cities up to required standards,
trade, please the gods, build monuments, wage warsâ€¦

The original game was remade from the ground up with new
graphics, music, and slightly updated mechanics. It is called
_Pharaoh: A New Era_, and if you're new to it, this is probably
the version you want to play. Although some tweaks are debatable,
it stays faithful to the original title and the updated
soundtrack is just gorgious
