There is a vibe to these games that I can't quite wrap my mind
around. The stories are over-the-top but that's what we want,
puzzles are quite easy to solve but still enjoyable for the most
part, the controls are easy and intuitive (let alone some
annoying quick time events)â€¦

They are just like a good comforting movie, flowing from one
scene to the next with beautiful scenery, but challenging enough
so they never get boring.

_Rise of the Tomb Raider_ is probably the one I enjoyed the most.
