I'm not particularly fond of RPGs, but this one just caught me.

The level of detail and care in this game is unmatched, from the
main story to the most obscure side quest, from the wild
landscapes to the towns full of life.

The two DLCs are incredible:

-  _Hearts of Stone_ builds up on the base game to tell a deep
   story
-  _Blood and Wine_ is basically another game: a huge new map and
   a whole new story that is probably as rich as the one of the
   main game, with some quests being absolute gems

Alsoâ€¦ Gwent!! I may have spent as much time playing this in-game
card game than the game itself.
