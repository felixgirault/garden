_Kind of a playable Pixar movie._

Stating the obvious first: this one is really, really beautiful.
Not the kind of over-the-top tech demo but a coherent world with
great art direction and animation that feels up to movie
standards.

Gameplay-wise, it is a short but solid action-adventure game,
kind of a metroidvania, with well thought-of abilities, various
ennemies and quite challenging bossfights.
