_The true sense of wonder._

This is a rare and perfectly executed match of adventure and
environmental puzzles.

A solar system is dying in an endless time loop, and you've got
to figure out why. Unlike most of other games, you're left
without any objectives or directions, apart from this one big
mystery. You're free to hop on your space shuttle and visit every
planet, driven by your own curiosity.

And boy does this game knows how to pique your curiosity.
Although being relatively small, each planet is a world in
itself, with its own landscape, its own sounds, its own bendy
laws of physics. One is slowly eaten by a black hole at its core,
while another is covered in water and swirling cyclones. Two
other ones are orbiting around each other while all the sand
surface from the first flows onto the second.

Amazingly, the DLC is on par with the main title, offering even
trickier puzzles based on new mechanics, and a deeper story that
expands on the original one.
