_The one and only open world._

This is the best-selling video game of all times, and amazingly
some people didn't play it yet.

It is kind of the ultimate game to me: an infinite world filled
with dozens of varied environments and creatures, the ability to
act on each and every piece of it, to create anything you'd
imagine, from small dirt shelters to full-on in-game computers.

Although being free of hard constraints, there's some goals to
the game which will lead you to explore every places and
mechanics of it. Fixed goals with infinite ways to reach them
makes for a perfect recipe for unforgettable adventures!
